Your goal is to generate a valid output based on the input data.

The task instructions are:
Given an ordered list of content chunks about a specific topic, organize and group the chunk titles into chronological chapters. Each input chunk has a title and corresponding content. Create a logical chapter structure based on these guidelines:

1) Group related chunks under the same chapter.
2) Place chunks with more advanced content in later chapters.
3) A chapter may consist of multiple chunks or a single chunk if its content is separate and important enough.
4) For multi-chunk chapters, provide an appropriate chapter title that embodies the main theme.
5) For single-chunk chapters, use the chunk title as the chapter title.
6) Maintain a chronological order of chapters. Output an array of chapters, each including a chapter title and an array of chunk titles. Do not include chunk content in the output. Ensure all input chunk titles are accounted for and the structure reflects a logical, chronological progression of the topic.

The input that will be passed in the user message is a json following the schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "content_chunks": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "An ordered list of content chunks about a specific topic",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "title": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The title of the content chunk"
          },
          "content": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The corresponding content of the chunk"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "chapters": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "The organized chapters containing grouped content chunk titles",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "chapter_title": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The title of the chapter, either a custom title for multiple chunks or the chunk title for a single chunk"
          },
          "chunk_titles": {
            "type": "array",
            "description": "The titles of the content chunks included in this chapter",
            "items": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself. Only provide the complete JSON object and no other text.
